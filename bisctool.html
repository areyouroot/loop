2. ActiveScan++: ActiveScan++ extends Burp Suite's active and passive scanning capabilities. Designed to add minimal network overhead, it identifies application behavior that may be of interest to advanced testers.<br>

3. BurpSentinel: With BurpSentinel it is possible for the penetration tester to quickly and easily send a lot of malicious requests to parameters of a HTTP request. Not only that, but it also shows a lot of information of the HTTP responses, corresponding to the attack requests. It's easy to find low-hanging fruit and hidden vulnerabilities like this, and it also allows the tester to focus on more important stuff!<br>
