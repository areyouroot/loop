lets work with the DB so create a new data base using the object explorer

1)creating a Table:
___________________

    click on the + near the database which u created then right click on tables -> new -> table

    give details like column name and data type and allownulls or not
    
    after filling the details press x so that it asks to save as or just save 

    u will see the table is created under the tables folder and if not refresh it or create again

    dbo - means database owner

    if u had a excel as the database then copy the contents only the values and then right click on the dbo which u created -> edit top 200 rows right click on arrow and paste

    the copied data can be edited

    u can print all the data using select statement


2)new query:
_____________

    click on new query (note : the query windows is too powerful it can also access the systerm database so use it with full mind )

    u can see a drop down box at top right it will show the current database click on it and u can change the db 
    
    if u are in the master db u can use the keyword "use"

        syntax :    use [dbname]
                    go

        eg: use [testdb] 
            go
