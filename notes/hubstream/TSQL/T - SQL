what is T-SQL ?

▢›Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft SQL Server's implementation of the standard SQL.
▢›Transact-SQL (T-SQL) has it's own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard.
▢›Used to perform actions on a SQL Server database.
▢›Create new databases, tables and other objects.
▢›Add user accounts ,modify and manage access permissions.
▢›Run maintenance tasks
▢›Query database: retrieve data ,Insert records, update records, delete records from a database
▢›Create stored procedures in a database

what is SQL server

the micrsoft SQL server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.
Used to Store and retrive data request by applications
runs on windows and linux
it can be a remote or dedicated server
sql server is an instance
SQL is a language used to intract with the RDBMS

hardware and software requirements ?

this can change as time please GPT or google it

types of SQL server based on implementation

->on-premises == this is local installation on the own remote or local device
->SQL on Azure == this a cloud instance of the SQL server provided by the Azure

What is SQL Server Management Studio -SSMS

= SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE)
that provides a graphical interface for connecting and working with MS SQL Sever.

= it is a free tool provided by Microsoft to manage SQL Servers

= Used by professionals like database administrators and developers.

= Used to access, configure,manage,administer and develop all components of SQL Server.

lets work with the DB so create a new data base using the object explorer

1)creating a Table:

---

    click on the + near the database which u created then right click on tables -> new -> table

    give details like column name and data type and allownulls or not

    after filling the details press x so that it asks to save as or just save

    u will see the table is created under the tables folder and if not refresh it or create again

    dbo - means database owner

    if u had a excel as the database then copy the contents only the values and then right click on the dbo which u created -> edit top 200 rows right click on arrow and paste

    the copied data can be edited

    u can print all the data using select statement

2)new query:

---

    click on new query (note : the query windows is too powerful it can also access the systerm database so use it with full mind )

    u can see a drop down box at top right it will show the current database click on it and u can change the db

    if u are in the master db u can use the keyword "use"

        syntax :    use [dbname]
                    go

        eg: use [testdb]
            go

last seen - https://youtu.be/PaNpV-15_YY?list=PLnIuGyeSptxhRhnWhPw2kunS6h4MRgo1i&t=1081

why we use GO

    go is used to represent a batch
    if any query is failed to execute it can be seperated by go and make other queries execute or make seperate groups

there is always a backup file created in c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.SQLSERVERNAME\MSSQL\Backup

click on new query to work with the database

u can have temporavary variables in the ms sql and also define the commands in it

    DECLARE @varuiablename AS DATATYPE = VALUE

    eg:
        declare @mayvar as int = 2;

    to update it

    set @variable = value

    eg:
        set @myvar = 2;

u can also perform the operations like add subtract multiply etc .....

there are other data types also that u can check out

there are some functions related to maths operations like powerc square power etc .....

u can alos convert form one datatype to another

u also have the string manuplation and operations

TRIM
As mentioned in the previous video, LTRIM removes space from the beginning of a string, and RTRIM removes spaces from the end.

As of SQL Server 2017, there is a new function - TRIM - which does both. However, don't use this on SQL Server 2016 or earlier, as it won't work.

u also have methods like try_convert that is like try parse and returns null on fail

u can also concat 2 string values

Want more string functions?
We've covered a lot of string functions here. I could continue, but I don't want to drown you in functions at this stage!

If you want more string functions, or more information on them, please have a look at my YouTube videos (all of these bullet points are hyperlinked):

SQL Server ASCII and CHAR functions, including tabs and carriage returns

Searching for text in SQL Server: CHARINDEX and PATINDEX

More to come in future weeks.

If you don't want to see these videos yet, no problems! These are bonus videos which you may find useful later.

Thank you very much for reading this, and keep learning!

Non-English locales, and Books Online
Is your SSMS set up in English? If so, please go to the next video.

If not, then...

As you have seen in the previous video, Microsoft has recommended that you create dates in this format:

'2025-01-01'

However, this doesn't necessarily work if you are using an interface language other than English. In the next video, I'll use the statement:

declare @mydate as datetime = '2015-06-24 12:34:56.124'

If this doesn't work on your version of SQL Server, then please use one of the following 2 formats instead:

declare @mydate as datetime = '20150624 12:34:56.124'

declare @mydate as datetime = '2015-06-24T12:34:56.124'

In the first statement, you remove the hyphens. In the second statement, use a letter T instead of a space between the date and time. However, this only works if you have a time part.

If you have any questions, please let me know in the Q&A.

Keep learning!

u can save the date directly and if ur product is overseas then check out datetime offset

u can also select a part of the entire string usning the functions like left etc ......

u can give having as a keyword to filter the data haveing some value eg:
    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY Country
    HAVING COUNT(\*) > 5
    ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;


unique constrain is a constraint that is only made for the primary key 

default constraint is used for giving the default values like null or defaut date etc ......

check constraint it is like giving a conditon befor the allocation like the money cannot be higher than 500 or lower than the 500 etc like that during the defenition or later

union combaines all the data in the maching feilds , unionall just prints the duplicates also
intersect selects all the data that intersect and except does opposite

u have switch case statement that is represented as case

eg:
    select case when @myoption = optionm a then do this 
                second condition
            else condition 

Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters
Setting up multiple parameters is very easy. Just list each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:

Example
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:

Example
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';

u can see the existance of the table or the recod using the if 

u can also use the while statements for looping

u also have the try an catch in the sqlu can also throw the error
