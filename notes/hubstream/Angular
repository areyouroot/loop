Type Script -

    What is Type Script ? 

        TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

    the Type script is also a Super set of js means js + more functions

features of type script -

    - static checker - this is used to debug the code while typing 
    - every code is converted in to js then compiled

Steps to install the angular -

    first install the node 
    then install and update the npm
    then install angular cli using this command 
        npm install -g @angular/cli
    then create a directory for the new app
    cmd is 
        ng new "application name without quotes use _ or - no avoid space and do avoid the word 'test' "
    depending on the angular version you are using you will be asked some default questions
    like do u like to add angular routing (y/n)
    or the css versions 

    press enter for the both questions to select the default

    angular uses the type script
    then use cd cmd to go inside the angular folder
    then run the develpement server
        ng serve
    the server is running in local host 4200

this is almost similar to the react but some new keywords and different internal working

CLI Deep Dive & Troubleshooting
In the next lecture, we're going to build our first little app!

If the CLI prompts you to answer some questions (some versions do that), you can simply hit ENTER for all questions. This will accept the default settings which are fine for this course.

The CLI generates a different welcome screen than you're going to see in my video though. No worries, you'll still be able to follow along without issues! Just make sure to code along so that your code equals mine - Angular itself didn't change a bit :)

If you want to dive deeper into the CLI and learn more about its usage, have a look at its official documentation: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki

You encountered issues during the installation of the CLI or setup of a new Angular project?

A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.

Updating NodeJS:

Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.

Updating npm:

Run [sudo] npm install -g npm  (sudo  is only required on Mac/ Linux)

Updating the CLI

[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli 

npm cache verify 

[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli 

Here are some common issues & solutions:

Creation of a new project takes forever (longer than 3 minutes)
That happens on Windows from time to time => Try running the command line as administrator

You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)
You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT  to serve your project on a new port

My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)
Check if the window running ng serve  displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI
    

angular strict mode 

    this is a mode used while creating the app the strict mode
    Angular CLI creates all new workspaces and projects with strict mode enabled. Strict mode improves maintainability and helps you catch bugs ahead of time.

    TO CREATE A APP IN THE STRICT MODE 
        ng new "app name without quotes" --strict  

    more on strict mode - https://angular.io/guide/strict-mode

    if u dont want the strict mode then specify as --no-strict
        ng new "app name without quotes" --no-strict  

same like react the angular also displays an empty page on the error occurance

to use a particular module in the angular u need to download it using npm command then import it in the app.module.ts to use it in the main script or the html then u need to edit the imports section in the app.module.ts

    eg let me use a module called FormsModule

        for this module it is already installed with the angular cli so we are going to import it directly

    inside the app.module.ts

        import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
        import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
        import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

        import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

        @NgModule({
          declarations: [
            AppComponent
          ],
          imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            FormsModule
          ],
          providers: [],
          bootstrap: [AppComponent]
        })
        export class AppModule { }

    as u can see we have added 2 new lines 

    1.
        import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

    2.    
        imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            FormsModule
          ],

this was a module for ngModel that is used to get the input and change the variable dynamically
