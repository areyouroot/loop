The contractor oriented language was basically means that the smart contracts are the main way that you organize code and like stored data in my audio programming life And the high level language for able to be smart contracts looks a lot like javascript and you know python and C++ And you see right here And it's used to run on your theory and virtual machine It was basically you know a thing that runs the codeso something is a statly type as opposed to type language And it supports it like inheritance libraries and what other stuff So enough I'm talking about solidity Let's actually jump in and start riding some solidity code This is a website that allows you to write solidity smart contracts in your browser

https://remix.ethereum.org/

install 2 plugins in vscode if uare usingvs code 

1)solidity by juan blanco (optional)
2)remix

you can also install remix in existing code editor such as vscode as a extension

first smart contract:

u will have some basic folders and files do use web ide for now folders are contractscripts test read me the text a JSM file etc etc

----------------------------code----------------------------------------------------------

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract testcon{
    
    //declar global variables and function
    string value;
    
    //constructor declaration
    constructor() public{
        value="hello"; 
    }
    
    //function declaration
    function get() public view returns(string){ 
        return value;

    }
    
    function set(string _value)public{
        value = _value;
        //function local variable
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pragma solidity ^0.4.24; -- this is the version of the solidity used here ^ represents higher than 0.4.24

note: the smart contract which you are going to type is going to be fully online so anyone can read it anyone can use it and etc

contract testcon{
    string value;
}

contract is similar to class but here is called as contract and it is an object on its own

    string value;

datatype and variables solidity is a statically typed language so evey variable u create is stored in blockchain

the variables are not local it will be stored in blockchain and will repesent as the contract variable

to declar a function u can use the keyword function

eg:

    function get() public returns(string){ 
        return value;

    }
    function set(string _value)public{
        value = _value;
        //function local variable and the local variable is _value
    }

where get() and set() are function same as other languages function

public represents acceseblity public means anyone can access form any contract

returns(datatype) this represents what data type will it return

constructors:

they are automatically ran when the contract is called or the contract gets the scope constructor are called with constructor keyword

in web ide after typing the code select the compiler and compile it by selecting a sutable vm deploy after deploying u will see a new test node running click on it to access the fuctionality

to run in remix vscode extention dee the remic tutorial and ganache tutorial

for the solidity above the version 0.5.1 code :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pragma solidity 0.5.1;
contract testcon{
    
    //declar global variables and function
    string value;
    
    //constructor declaration
    constructor() public{
        value="hello"; 
    }
    
    //function declaration
    function get() public view returns(string memory){ 
        return value;

    }
    
    function set(string memory _value)public{
        value = _value;
        //function local variable
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

note this may not work in new versions due to changes

if u declare your variables to be public then u can see the values directly

eg: this code can be replaced

    string value;
    
    //constructor declaration
    constructor() public{
        value="hello"; 
    }
    
    //function declaration
    function get() public view returns(string memory){ 
        return value;

    }

    with this

    string public value = "hello"

    this will create a new button by which u can access the value of value (variable)

    
declaration of different datatypes
_________________________________________________________________________________________

pragma solidity 0.5.1;

contract Mycont{
    string public stringv="string";
    bool public boolv=false;
    // int normal integer values can be stored
    // int8 only 8 bytes of integer can be stored
    // uint unsigned integer no + or - can be represented
    // uint122 etc only 122 bytes of unsigned integer can be stored
    int112 public intv=123;
}

_________________________________________________________________________________________

-----------------------------------enum program------------------------------------------
pragma solidity 0.5.1;

contract mycon{
    enum state{wait,ready,active}
    state public status;
    constructor()public{
        status=state.wait;//option 0 is assign
    }
    function activate() public{
        status=state.active;//assigning the 2nd option
    }
    function isactive()public view returns(bool){
        return status == state.active;
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in this program u can see a key word called enum which is used for coustom user object and its states

here u can see 3 states wait ready active and run this to see the working

----------------------------------user data allocation using struct-----------------------

this struct is as same as in the c programing language used to declare the objects

simple usage is 

___________________________________________________________________________________________
pragma solidity 0.5.1;

contract mycontract{

    person[] public people; // declaration of object the length of the object is not assigned

    uint256 public peoplecount; //keeping track of number of items

    struct person{  //object structure declaration

        string firstname;
        string lastname;

    }

    function addperson(string memory firstname,string memory lastname)public{

        people.push(person(firstname,lastname)); // push is a method to add data in a array and that object is an array
        peoplecount ++;
        
    }

}

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

the above program can be also be returend as dynamic mapping using pointers :

__________________________________________________________________________________________
pragma solidity 0.5.1;

contract mycontract{

    uint256 public peoplecount;
    mapping(uint => person)public people; //creating a mapping functrion

    struct person{

        uint id;
        string firstname;
        string lastname;

    }

    function addperson(string memory firstname,string memory lastname)public{
        
        peoplecount ++;
        people[peoplecount]=(person(peoplecount,firstname,lastname));
        
    }

}
__________________________________________________________________________________________
note: the mapping code will not show any error it will show the default values with is nothing or zero
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

now we are going to lok about the acess modifiers
 
types of acess 

1) public - this will show the functunalities in the webpage when we run it
2) internal - these are the private functions which can be only acess by the contrat internal functions

there is a datatype called address where all address is stored

syntax:

address owner;

_________________________________________modifiers______________________________________________

Function modifier can be executed before or after the function executes its code. The modifiers can be used when there is a need to verify the condition automatically before executing a particular function. If the given condition is not satisfied, then the function will not get executed.

syntax:
modifier method_name() {
action block;
}
