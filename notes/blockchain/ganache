download the ganache setup then execute it

run it 

use quick start to run the local block chain

for advance block chain select the new workspace option

this block chain is local and test only

the eth provided by the ganach is test only eth so u cannot use the eth out side the testing network or the local network

never use the private key provided by the ganache out side the local network 

mostly the network id and the rpc server is only used for developement

we can save switch the work spaces

we need to modify the truffel.config file to connect to the network if you are using remix just use the ip:port where the application is running

--------------------------truffel-config.js-----------------------------

// uncomment out the developement option

        developement:{
            host:"127.0.0.1",
            port:8545,              //mention what is given in ganache
            network_id:1234,        //mention what is given in ganache
            //if network id is * this means it can be any network id 

        },

//you can go to ganach setting -> server to change all the credentials

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the migrations folder where all files are present you can create a file and eploy a smart contract

## note ##

the above method is only for truffel users

--------------------------ganache usping npm--------------------------------------
