this is decentralize so all are involved 

sha256 hash is used  

use blockchaindemo.io for reference

the mining is a process of finding the nonce number so the hash becomes 000d something
and the minner doesnt need to solve any problems they need gpu to do the task

u can built applications over the eth chain or any block chain and each block chain has
its own purpose
