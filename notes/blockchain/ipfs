pls download the go-ipfs exe and use powershell it is best in windows if i mention git bash anywhere ignore it

first download the exe version if u are uing windows 

the ipfs is aka interplanitary file system this is a decentralized method to store data

there are 2 node in a network its a ipfs client and server

copy the ipfs to the c:/user/user/apps/kubo/ipfs

the create an alias or create a env variable

the cmd whe ipfs is typed the exe should run

go to the project location 

type 

#ipfs init

this will intiate local ipfs

then after this cmd it will generate a key copy and paste it to verify the installation is it sucessful?

eg:

PS C:\Users\abdul\Desktop\git works\clg project\block-play\DFS-v1.0 - test\dfs> ipfs init
generating ED25519 keypair...done
peer identity: 12D3KooWQcoMDHczPZw5DqR43XrGE1qddgJ
initializing IPFS node at C:\Users\abdul\.ipfs
to get started, enter:

        ipfs cat /ipfs/QmQPeNsJPyVWPFDVHbz4bG2X8D2GhfbSXc/readme

copy what ever is after ipfs cat and paste it in this command

#ipfs cat <content>

eg:

ipfs cat /ipfs/QmQPeNsJPyVWPFDVHbz4bG2X8D2GhfbSXc/readme



to disable the init go where the config file is located and delete it

or delete this folder C:\Users\abdul\.ipfs

copy the contents of that command 

try to upload any file by this command 

#ipfs add file-location

to access that file back do remember the hash it had generated when the file was uploaded

eg

$ ipfs add ./DFS-v1.0\ -\ test/dfs/hell.txt

added QmTtkGE5tKP8yWjHUi3LCTf3wJaVvvE7 hell.txt

350 B / 350 B [================================================================================================================================] 100.00% 

you can upload a folder using -r argument which means recursive

eg:

ipfs add -r ./babanaidu
