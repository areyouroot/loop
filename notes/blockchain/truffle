install nodejs

using npm install truffel

#npm init
#npm i truffle -g //to install globally

once the truffle is properly installed check its version so that it is properly installed

#truffle version //do it in other shell out side the vscode

to create the configurations type

#truffle init

update the solidity using npm

create any simple smart contract in the contracts folder like this 

contract.sol:

pragma solidity *;

contract test{
    
    //declar global variables and function
    string value;
    
    //constructor declaration
    constructor() public{
        value="hello"; 
    }
    
    //function declaration
    function get() public view returns(string){ 
        return value;

    }
    
    function set(string _value)public{
        value = _value;
        //function local variable
    }

}

the we need to change some config in the truffle so open the truffle-config file 

u can change the compiler version if you want

to compile all of the smartcontracts in the contracts folder use 

#truffle compile 

u can also remove the compiled code by just deleting the build folder

rm -rf ./build/

to write the test script u have to use the js as language and it should be under the test folder

after writing a test script u can use the command 

#truffle test 

to start the test ,here i will say use remix its better because it shows the visual aspects but here no visual aspects are showen

here the test will automaticall lanch the ganache for execution

deployment of blockchain
-------------------------

to deply the contract first we have to create a migration and name it 

copy the content of intial migrations then change the word migration and replace it with your contract name

again i will say remix is better 

then to deploy the contract 

#truffle migrationcontractname

it will give a ip and 10 wallets an accounts

then use in the truffle shell

>migrate --reset
