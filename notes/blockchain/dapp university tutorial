EVM-compatible blockchains

There is a long list of projects that have launched an EVM-compatible layer one blockchain, but here are some of the top 15.

Ethereum
Ethereum Classic
Binance Smart Chain
Fantom
Polygon
Avalanche
Cardano
Tron
solana (not directly executes solidity)
Polkadot
Binance Smart Chain
Tron
Uniswap
Zhcash
Hedera Hashgraph

can solidity code can be run in solana ?

AI: Yes, you can use the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 Solidity code from openzeppelin to deploy an NFT contract on Solana. Solana supports the use of Solidity for writing smart contracts, and it has its own ERC-like token standards that are similar to those used on Ethereum.

besides the solidity u need a secondary language like javascript

javascript can be used for automation and frount end and back end ui etc...............

some frameworks that can get handy are

1.hardhat
2.react (frount end)
3.ethers js library
