to use tkubernetes u need to have hyper v and docker

kubernetes are like same as docker abut the master node controls all the slave docker nodes and most of the commands are similar like docker

yaml file is used here to control the config of the kuberneties

here the stucture is like mainserver(kubernetes master)->slave servers (pods)->docker containers

to enable kubernetes in windows go to docker desktop then select settings and select kubernetes tab and press enable 

then go to google and download kubectl and install it

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/ 

here u will get a curl link download it and the go to add a env variable to the exe location the if any shell is running close it and restart the shell

type kubectl to verify wheter it is there or not
