to use tkubernetes u need to have hyper v and docker

kubernetes are like same as docker abut the master node controls all the slave docker nodes and most of the commands are similar like docker

yaml file is used here to control the config of the kuberneties

here the stucture is like mainserver(kubernetes master)->slave servers (pods)->docker containers

to enable kubernetes in windows go to docker desktop then select settings and select kubernetes tab and press enable 

then go to google and download kubectl and install it

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/ 

here u will get a curl link download it and the go to add a env variable to the exe location the if any shell is running close it and restart the shell

type kubectl to verify wheter it is there or not

to see the config file type # kubectl config current-context

to get all the nodes connected type # kubectl get nodes

same for pods  # kubectl get pods

kubernetes uses the master slave concept but the worker nodes are called as worker not slave

the structure is given in png file 2 

the command to verify and check the version of kube ctl is #kubectl version --client 

to install and run kubernetes as a su node of a single pc or to just learn u can use minikube the link is https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

to print minikube version and verifiy the installation type #minikube version

then the minikube need to be started any of the virtual machine manager that the minikube suports put it in the cmd and run it 

run this command as a admin if hyper v avoid docker because it has some limitations
#minikube start --driver=hyperv

to delete the existing drivers use 
#minikube delete

run it after the start command
#minikube status

this should print 
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured

to get minikube ip use 
#minikube ip
192.168.49.2

you can ssh the docker running in the virtual minikube cluster by #ssh docker@ip

if u are using docker as the driver then use this cmd the above cmd will not work in case of docker
#minikube ssh

the ssh will ask for the fingure print type yes and the default password and uname is 
uname : docker
password : tcuser

u can see all the docker containers running in with this cmd 
#docker ps 

you can see the minikube cluster connetion info by 
#kubectl cluster-info 

you can get list of all connecteed node in kubeclt by this cmd
#kubectl get nodes

you can get list of all connecteed pods in kubeclt by this cmd
#kubectl get pods

you can print all of the name spaces that is like url inside the kubectl to call different objects use 
#kubectl get namespaces

you can call all of the pods related to a name space for eg there is a website that has many pods running like sql,apace etc .. you can print all pods in that name space 
#kubectl get pods --namespace=[name space that is needed]
eg :#kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system

pods are created in every node 

as docker u can create containers in side a pod with same cmd as docker 
eg :#kubectl run nginx --image=ngnix
#kubectl run [pod name] --image=[docker image to be used]

check the status if the pod is runningh then only its running else its in process

you can print all the details of a pod using cmd 
#kubectl describe pod ngnix

The ip address u will get here is internal ip address running in kube proxy so u cant connect directly

You can delete a specific pods by mentioning in the pod command
Eg :#kubectl delete pod ngnix
#kubectl delete pod [pod name]

So if u are going to create multiple deployment then u can use a file deployment with precofig file so that same specifications like port etc will be same and images etc

To create a deployment file 
#kubectl create deployment [deployment name] --image=[image name]
Eg :#kubectl create deployment ngnix-dep --image=ngnix
