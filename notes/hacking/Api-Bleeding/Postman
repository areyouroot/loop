this is a tutorial for the postman tool in worst case use the curl cli

download and install postman as the extension or the msi application

this is almost same as the custome request the ui is easy so you can see whats appening and u can select the method of acceptance get post etc ...

u can make collections a group of api request 

you can share the collections and monitor like send it periodically 


you can have the variables also like {{variable name}} this can be defined in the left handside tab ... u can reuse the request to send the set of paylods or the url itself

if u enable the postman console then u can see all the request and the response of the postman that is generated

u can also program what it will send in the console u can program all it does

u can create a set of envirment where all the default  variables are loaded and the scripts also 

u can duplicate the environment
