the recon is a process of infog

u should know the route where ur packets are traveling for that u can use 

    windows - tracert,pathping
    linux - traceroute

    the path ping will give extra details like rute time etc ..

this will show the number of hops that is needed and it will also show the route of the package flowing

it will not work with all of the decives due to lack of icmp support

u can see the information about the deices that are connected to the currrent network 

    windows - nslookup
    all - dig (recomended)

always google for new updates and the methods

local netork config

    windows - ipconfig
    any thing with nework tools - ifconfig

u can see the network reachablity for this u can use ping

    all - ping

u can get all the network statistics using 

    all - netstat

the local arp table can be printed it will consist of local devices ip and mac address

    all - arp
    eg: arp -a

to see the routing table 

    windows - route print
    all - netstat -r

u can see all the dns domines like mail server etc ... use 

    #:host domin name

    eg#host google.com

u can enumerate the DNS

    dnsrecon domin name

    and 

    dnsenum domin name

to enumerate the domine use amass

    #amass

nmap is used to enumerate the network

    nmap

    u can see all the usage in the help command 

    u can run the scripts of nmap u can locate the nse scripts using the locate command

the server can be scaned for the vulnerablity 

    #nikto

u can brutforce the requests and the domine and etc using the dirbuster or the gobuster

    #gobuster

    #dirbuster (gui version of dirb)

    #dirb

    the word list can be custome 

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a client-server communication protocol that is used for shared access to files, directories, printers, serial ports, and other resources on a network. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. Server Message Block (SMB) file system.

this can also be exploited

    smbmap

    smbclient can be used for the login
