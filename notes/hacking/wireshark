this a network traffic capturer or analyser or anything this is depens on the used

almost the gui is easy u can select the network then start eves droping networktraffic capture etc 

at the right had side after lanching the wireshark in a network u will have the default profile so change the profile as you want 

using the wireshark terminal u can capture the files and store the cap file in the background

u have a search bar in that u can search the packet type like http or tcp or any other reference or the protocol

u can use "frame contains word to be searched" he case should be matched
if u want to search in regex use "frame matches word"

there is 2 different filtures one is capture filture and one is simple filture

dont over set the capture filture cause if u send the tcp request if that failed it might reply with the icmp so be careful what you use

u can also right click on the traffic and have custome filtures it will automatically generate the command for the filture

u have the option called preserve so that u can append to the existing filter it will be avalible only when u right click on the traffic

u can also see the loactions of the network traffic in the wireshark - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlVppluWTHw&list=PLW8bTPfXNGdC5Co0VnBK1yVzAwSSphzpJ&index=10
note u need to update the geoip database frequenly for more accuracy
