Please note that while they can tell you whether your policy in use is secure, they cannot tell you
whether they are fully adequate, since this depends heavily upon what actions your application
performs.

Mitigation Recommendations:
Implement these headers in their order of importance. The more policies you can implement, the
more security issues that these headers can help you prevent.

BurpSuite
Professional
Application,
API, and

Burp Suite Professional serves as an upgrade from the
Community Edition. This software suite contains a
multitude of professional grade modules which allow its users to
test various use cases in exploitation of
vulnerabilities such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS), XML Entity
Injection and Expansion (XXE), SQL Injection and
more. This software allows for the saving of “states” which can
then be used other authorized testers to
collaborate on findings discovered. Additionally, this tool set
allows for heavy manipulation of packet data through proxy
technology allowing a tester to simply freeze an inbound or
outbound packet and conduct manual testing.
