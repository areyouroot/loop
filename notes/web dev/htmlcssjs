CSS________________

before appling the css just finish the HTML code

this is a styling language used to style

first u have to create a link from html to trhe css file by link tag

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" herf="<enter the location of the file>">
    //this should be in the title tag
    //dont forget to add ./"for current directory" and ../ previous directory

then test ur connection by just changing the back ground color

    in the css

        body{
             background: red;
            }

few gradient example

    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp

    https://cssgradient.io/     //gradent generator

three types of selection 

    1)using the elementy tag 

        eg in  html file

            <p>hello there</p>
        
        eg in css file 

            p{
                color:red;
            }

    2)using class selector

        eg in html file

            <p class="<class name>">hello there</p>
           
            eg

                <p class="class1">hello theer</p>

        eg in css file

            .class1{
                color:blue:
            }

    3)using the inside

        eg in html file

            <p id="sometext">hellow there</p>

        eg in css file

            #sometext{
                color:blue;
            }

to scale the image and videos accordingly use this 

    https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/how+to+make+an+image+scale+with+window+size+css

the power of different selector class is given in this order

    element tag < class tag < id tag < in line change

psudo selector example

    <selector tag>:<action>{
        chnages to be made 
    }

    eg
        h1:hover{
            color:red;
        }

        //this is used when we hover the mouse over that line

        li:first-child <or> last-child <or> nth-child(<put the nuber of the child which u want to change>) <or> only-child{
            color:blue;
        }

        //the only-child only works on the lsit having only one child

        a:link{
            color:red; // tis will work on hyper link before visting
        }

        a:visited{
            color:blue; // tis will work on hyper link after visting
        }
 
you can comment the css by /*comment*/

special tags eg

    h2 + a{
        //changes to be made and here the changes will be implemented in the "a" tag which is after h2 tag parent tag independent
    }

    textarea ~ button{
        //changes to be made and here the changes will be implemented in the "button" tag which is after textarea tag works under the same parent tag
    }
    
    ul > li {
        //changes will be made to the li tags inside the ul if any other tagis there the effect will not be applied
        //this is only applicable when ul is child of li not nested list
    }

    ul li{
         //changes will be made to the li tags inside the ul if any other tagis there the effect will not be applied
        //this is applicable when ul is child of li even nested list
    }

attribute selectors

    h2[class="class value"]{
        //the changes is applied only in the h2 tags where the class value is mention above
    }

    img[src="image location"]{
        //put the style u wana applie
    }

    img[src^="half location"]{
        //the ^ is used to select the mutiple source which is containg the part of the location 
        //eg /img/ and u want to select all img under the /img/ then use it
    }

    img[src$="half location"]{
        //the $ is used to select the mutiple source which ends the part of the location 
        //eg /img/ and u want to select all img ends with /img/ then use it
    }

    img[src*="half location"]{
        //the * is used to select the all source which is containg the part of the location 
        //eg /img/ and u want to select all img under the /img/ then use it
    }

you can change the font color by just adding the property color in the css

        //this is used for font color
    }

    background: url("provide the local or the url to the img");
    //works in css
    //but the images will get repeted

    //ucan over come the repeting problem by this
