HTML_______________

any text editor can be used for us we use vscode
others are same and u know 

    <hr> - used to draw a _________________________________________________________________________ line

    <!-- this is used for comment -->

    <div>this is used to divide a page section</div>

to get the input u can use 

    <input type="<enter the type of the input u want text,password,date,email,range,file,checkbox,radiobutton,submit etc ...>" value="<enter the default value here>"
to define a rafio button

    <input name="<enter the same name to have a single choice>" type="radio">

to get huge paragraph inputs use text area tag

    <textarea rows="<number of words>" cols="<number of lines>"> "<put your default text here>" </textarea>

to check all. types of input see this page

    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp

forms in html

    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp

if you want to display a website inside another website then use iframe

    <iframe src="<enter the url>" height="<enter the height in numbers and collen>" width="<enter as given in height>">"<enter here the message to be displayed when the website is not displayed>"</iframe>


you can add the image usint this tag

    <img src=”(your image URL here or the file name)”>

other image manuplation see this //DONT FORGET TO SEETHE " AND ”

    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_images.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20insert%20any%20image,syntax%20to%20use%20this%20tag.&text=The%20tag%20is%20an,it%20has%20no%20closing%20tag.




CSS________________

before appling the css just finish the HTML code

this is a styling language used to style

first u have to create a link from html to trhe css file by link tag

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" herf="<enter the location of the file>">
    //this should be in the title tag
    //dont forget to add ./"for current directory" and ../ previous directory

then test ur connection by just changing the back ground color

    in the css

        body{
             background: red;
            }

few gradient example

    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp

    https://cssgradient.io/     //gradent generator

three types of selection 

    1)using the elementy tag 

        eg in  html file

            <p>hello there</p>
        
        eg in css file 

            p{
                color:red;
            }

    2)using class selector

        eg in html file

            <p class="<class name>">hello there</p>
           
            eg

                <p class="class1">hello theer</p>

        eg in css file

            .class1{
                color:blue:
            }

    3)using the inside

        eg in html file

            <p id="sometext">hellow there</p>

        eg in css file

            #sometext{
                color:blue;
            }

to scale the image and videos accordingly use this 

    https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/how+to+make+an+image+scale+with+window+size+css

the power of different selector class is given in this order

    element tag < class tag < id tag < in line change

psudo selector example

    <selector tag>:<action>{
        chnages to be made 
    }

    eg
        h1:hover{
            color:red;
        }

        //this is used when we hover the mouse over that line

        li:first-child <or> last-child <or> nth-child(<put the nuber of the child which u want to change>) <or> only-child{
            color:blue;
        }

        //the only-child only works on the lsit having only one child

        a:link{
            color:red; // tis will work on hyper link before visting
        }

        a:visited{
            color:blue; // tis will work on hyper link after visting
        }
 
you can comment the css by /*comment*/

special tags eg

    h2 + a{
        //changes to be made and here the changes will be implemented in the "a" tag which is after h2 tag parent tag independent
    }

    textarea ~ button{
        //changes to be made and here the changes will be implemented in the "button" tag which is after textarea tag works under the same parent tag
    }
    
    ul > li {
        //changes will be made to the li tags inside the ul if any other tagis there the effect will not be applied
        //this is only applicable when ul is child of li not nested list
    }

    ul li{
         //changes will be made to the li tags inside the ul if any other tagis there the effect will not be applied
        //this is applicable when ul is child of li even nested list
    }

attribute selectors

    h2[class="class value"]{
        //the changes is applied only in the h2 tags where the class value is mention above
    }

    img[src="image location"]{
        //put the style u wana applie
    }

    img[src^="half location"]{
        //the ^ is used to select the mutiple source which is containg the part of the location 
        //eg /img/ and u want to select all img under the /img/ then use it
    }

    img[src$="half location"]{
        //the $ is used to select the mutiple source which ends the part of the location 
        //eg /img/ and u want to select all img ends with /img/ then use it
    }

    img[src*="half location"]{
        //the * is used to select the all source which is containg the part of the location 
        //eg /img/ and u want to select all img under the /img/ then use it
    }

you can change the font color by just adding the property color in the css

    body{
        color: blue;
        //this is used for font color
    }

you can set background image by urls or local files also use url

    background: url("provide the local or the url to the img");
    //works in css
    //but the images will get repeted

    //ucan over come the repeting problem by this
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    //note: this will not repeat but size will be the original size

    //you can avoid it by this command
    background-size:cover;

you can control the font size like this

    fontsize:1cm;
    fontsize:1m;

u can control the text decoration 

    text-decoration:none;
    //remove all decoration
    text-decoration:underline;
    //underline
    text-decoration:line-through;
    //strick the words
    text-decoration:overline;
    //overline

yopu can control the case of the fonts with this

    text-transform:upercase;
                  :lowercase;
                  :capitalize;

you can change the text anlinement

    text-align:left;
              :right;
              :center;
              :justify;

you can change the font tickness by changing

    font-weight: 400;

you can change the font style

    font-style:italic;
              :oblique;
              :bold;

if u want to change the font family or style see this

    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp

if u want to check the view of the website in the different devices using
inspect in ur browser and eresponsive can change the real size

you can add the borderd to your content 

    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp

padding is inside the border and the margin is outside the border

you can just like that add and create the pading and the marjin

    margin:20px;
    padding:20px;

you can add the padding based ont the directions also like

    padding-left:20px;
    padding-right:20px;
    padding-bottom:20px;
    padding-top:20px;

    (or)

    padding: top right bottom left ;
    padding: 20px 40px 30px 0;

    //same for margin

float is used to set how a element shhould posses in  a page\
eg a image should be moved to right but text should take its place then use 
float

    float:position;
    float:right;
    float:left;
    up 
    bottom etc 

you can hide things for temprovary time using display 
and u can use javascript to do some crazy stuff

display 

    display:none;
    //hides that element

    display:inline; //puts in same line 
    display:inline-block; //put in the bottom line

install node

and install windows tools in npm

use #npx create-react-app app-name(location)

eg: npx create-react-app . // to create in current dir

    npx create-react-app reactapp


note if u are running windows pls use the powershell as native avoid vscode terminal

go to src folder remove all un nessary code and files leaving index.js and app.js and the content should be like 

index.js:

import React from "react";

function App() {
  return null
}

export default App;

app.js:

import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <todolist />
  )
}

export default App;

install es7 react/redux/graph...... in vs code extentions

to create new functions u can have a react closed html tag 

eg in app.js:

import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <todolist />
  )
}

export default App;


then create a new folder called todolist.js

then type rfc in the Todolist.js this lanch a template for function like this :

//note the template name and file name should start with caps else it will not recoginse

import React from 'react'

export default function Todolist() {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  )
}

then import the file in app.js eg :import Todolist from "./Todolist";

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

state
------

the react state gives the state of the program it can be used to append the data that was provided previously like u can call the elements from the database and give it Headers

useState-
____________

use state is a react componet used to update the variable value that reflect real time in the webpage which is not possible by the traditional methods

first u need to import hte react library

syntax:

import {useState} from react

const [variable,setvariable] = useState(say the default state);

eg:

import {useState} from react

const [variable,setvariable] = useState(""); //make sure the one is variable and another one is a "set" followed by the variable name to set the value of the variable
//or
const [variable,setvariable] = useState({});
//or
const [variable,setvariable] = useState("fruit");

//to change the value use setvariable

setvariable("some value")




What Does "(e)" Mean in JavaScript? - Event Handler Object Explained-

e is the object that contains the information about anm event that has recently occured

events like 

file upload 
click 
etc...

for all events and its properties check out - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event





Event.preventDefault()
The preventDefault() method of the Event interface tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be.

The event continues to propagate as usual, unless one of its event listeners calls stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation(), either of which terminates propagation at once.

As noted below, calling preventDefault() for a non-cancelable event, such as one dispatched via EventTarget.dispatchEvent(), without specifying cancelable: true has no effect.

Syntax
event.preventDefault()
Copy to Clipboard
Examples
Blocking default click handling
Toggling a checkbox is the default action of clicking on a checkbox. This example demonstrates how to prevent that from happening:

JavaScript
const checkbox = document.querySelector("#id-checkbox");

checkbox.addEventListener("click", checkboxClick, false);

function checkboxClick(event) {
  let warn = "preventDefault() won't let you check this!<br>";
  document.getElementById("output-box").innerHTML += warn;
  event.preventDefault();
}
Copy to Clipboard
HTML
<p>Please click on the checkbox control.</p>

<form>
  <label for="id-checkbox">Checkbox:</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="id-checkbox" />
</form>

<div id="output-box"></div>

Result:

Please click on the checkbox control.

Checkbox: ▢
preventDefault() won't let you check this!
preventDefault() won't let you check this!
preventDefault() won't let you check this!






The Problem
You may have come across JSX code in React like this snippet:

<Image {...aspects} source="img_source">
And wondered what these three dots ... are and what they do.

The Solution
These three dots are called the spread syntax or spread operator. The spread syntax is a feature of ES6, and it’s also used in React.

Spread syntax allows you to deconstruct an array or object into separate variables. Even though the syntax doesn’t look particularly meaningful when you first encounter it, spread syntax is super useful.

According to MDN:

Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.

This means is that you can use the array syntax in function calls, in array literals, and in object literals.

In React, you can use spread syntax to pass objects such as props without the need to pass individual values.

For example, these three components are equal:

function App1() {
  return <Image width="50" height="100" source="img_source" />;
}

function App2() {
  const props = { width: "50", height: "100" };
  return (
    <Image width={props.width} height={props.height} source="img_source" />
  );
}

function App3() {
  const props = { width: "50", height: "100" };
  return <Image {...props} source="img_source" />;
}
This syntax is particularly useful when you want to pass a dynamic object and do not know beforehand which properties might be present in it.

Another popular use case of spread syntax is to copy objects or arrays. Spread operator can create a new object or array with all of the properties or elements of the existing object or array.

For example:

const books = [
  { name: "War and Peace", read: true },
  { name: "Count of Monte Christo", read: true },
];

function addNewBook(newBook) {
  return [...books, { ...newBook, read: false }];
}

const updatedBookList = addNewBook({ name: "Lord of the Rings" });
In React, this comes in handy when you do not want to mutate specific data like state.






react hooks-
___________________

react hooks are used to dynamically change the contents of the webpage

the hook should always run

useState-
_____________

this is used for changing the variable value dynamically on the webpage without loading each time the value is updatedBookList

this uses 2 keywords that u can name any but the function part or the 2nd keyword should start with set for easy access and dont forget to add a capword after Set use camel case

syntax:

const [variable,setVariable] = useState(default value)

eg:

const [name,setName] = useState("jhon nicolis")

or

const [name,setName] = useState("")


to update the new value 

syntax

setVariable(value)

eg:

setName("baba durabai")

in useState dont pass the function directly it will run every time u change the state of the variable

eg:wrong method

const [name,setName] = useState(func())

the func will ran every time u change the state of the variable

correct method=>

const [name,setName] = useState(() => func())

this is a function calling the func it will be ran only once the state is declared

the useState does overwrite the whole data so if u pass it in the list and only want to change one element of that list or dictonary do use "..." so that it accesss the internal componunts 

eg:


setName({count:1,name:"kaja"})

if now we wana change the state only of the count then 

if u want to call the value morwe than twice in a program to change its value dont use the actuall variable 

eg:name here dont use it 

setName("kalim")
setName("margarit")

it will work only once to avoid it use the previous state method each state variable has a previous state variable
to access it use the "prev" followed by variable name and the first letter of the variable should be in caps

eg:

wrong way:

setName(count-1)

crt way:

setName(prevCount => prevCount-1 )


if u are using list inside the state do use "..." to access it else whole thing will be over written

useEffect hook-
__________________

the a use effect hook is used when the usestate is rendered 

this is like side effect of the usestate 

when ever the web page is rendered the use effect is also active

u can also metion the change on the particular resource type which is given in the use state

syntax:

import { useState,useEffect } from 'react'

app(){
    const [anyvariable,setAnyvariable] = useState('chaud')
    const [useeffectvar,setUseeffectvar] = useState('mc stan')

    setAnyvariable("anyvalue change")
    setUseeffectvar("change any")


    //method 1 it runs on same state change also io. last == now value 

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("use state is used")
    })

    //on change of the useEffectvar method 2

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("use state is useeffect var is change")
    },[useeffectvar]) //this will automatically generate on the render of useEffectvar

    //method 3 on mount this runs when the web page is a loaded

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("use state is useeffect var is change")
    },[])

    //this can also reder when u resize the window and u can listent to the mouse cyursor window width etc

    //METHOD 4 THIS is when any one of the state is triggered

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("use state is useeffect var is change")
    },[useeffectvar,anyvariable])
}


more on use effect - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJgIjIuY7U&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h&index=3







//ignore all of this below
//</Image>
///</br>
//</or>
/</put>
/</or>
/</or>
/</action>







useMemo-
____________

memo is used to cache the function value so that every thing is executed fast

do not use it every time because it might slow down the process due to huge memory saved in cache

syntax:

const funcionname = useMemo((args) => {
    return slowfunctionname(args)
},[variable that cause this function to run so that only this function runs when this variable changes])

//html return

return(<>functionname args=args</>)


eg: code

import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react'
export default function App() {
const [number, setNumber] = useState(0)
const [dark, setDark] = useState(false)
const doubleNumber = useMemo (() => {
return slowFunction(number)
}, [number])
const themeStyles = {
backgroundColor: dark? 'black' : 'white',
color: dark? 'white': 'black'
}
}
return (
<input type="number" value={number} onChange={e => setNumber (parseInt
(e.target.value))} />
<button onClick={() => setDark (prevDark => !prevDark)}>Change Theme</button>
<div style={themeStyles}>{doubleNumber}</div>
</>
function slowFunction (num) {
console.log('Calling Slow Function')
for (let i = 0; i <= 1000000000; i++) {}
return num * 2



useRef-
____________

the useRef is used a variable that need to be rendered in the useEffect 
u cannot ue the useState variable it will go into the infinite loop so avoid


as the useState it also creactes the variable but it is a object not a variable holding value so to access the variable value use 

userefvariable.current = assign the value

this is how u assign and use this variable

eg pro:

﻿

import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
export default function App() {
const [name, setName] = useState('')
const renderCount = useRef(0)
useEffect(() => {
})
renderCount. current = renderCount.current + 1
return (
<>
<input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}/> <div>My name is {name}</div>
<div>I rendered {renderCount.current} times</div>
</>
>
}





eg pro 2 -------------------

﻿

import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
export default function App() {
=
const [name, setName] const inputRef useRef()
function focus() {
}
useState('')
inputRef.current.focus()
return (
<>
<input ref={inputRef} value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}/>
<div>My name is {name}</div>
<button onClick={focus}>Focus</button>
</>


output:

<textbox:>input value</textbox>

myname is input value

<button> focus </button>





useContext-
_________________________________________________________________________

this used to globalize the state variable or other data variables to whole react app

React Context is a way to manage state globally.

It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.


like local variables cannot be accessed outside the function,class or the file



how to use the useContext

The Solution
The solution is to create context.

Create Context
To create context, you must Import createContext and initialize it:

import { useState, createContext } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const UserContext = createContext()
Next we'll use the Context Provider to wrap the tree of components that need the state Context.

Context Provider
Wrap child components in the Context Provider and supply the state value.

function Component1() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Jesse Hall");

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1>
      <Component2 user={user} />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}
Now, all components in this tree will have access to the user Context.

Use the useContext Hook
In order to use the Context in a child component, we need to access it using the useContext Hook.

First, include the useContext in the import statement:

import { useState, createContext, useContext } from "react";
Then you can access the user Context in all components:

function Component5() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 5</h1>
      <h2>{`Hello ${user} again!`}</h2>
    </>
  );
}




the program without the useContext-
_________________________________________________________________________

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Component1() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Jesse Hall");

Hello Jesse Hall!

Component 5
Hello Jesse Hall again!


u can call the useContext folder in a class file but in function file u need to re define then use 

class
eg:

﻿

import React, { Component } from 'react' 
import { ThemeContext } from './App'
export default class ClassContextComponent extends Component { 
    themeStyles (dark) {
return {
backgroundColor: dark ? '#333' : '#CCC',
color: dark ? '#CCC': '#333',
padding: '2rem',
margin: '2rem'
}
}
render() {
return (
<ThemeContext.Consumer>
{darkTheme => {
}}
return <div style={this.themeStyles (dark Theme)}>Class
Theme</div>
}}
</ThemeContext.Consumer>
)




useContext for function files:


import React, { useContext } from 'react' 
import { ThemeContext } from './App'
export default function FunctionContextComponent() { 
    const dark Theme = useContext (ThemeContext)  // new obj declaration
const themeStyles = {
backgroundColor: darkTheme ? '#333' : '#CCC', color: dark Theme ? '#CCC': '#333',
padding: '2rem',
margin: '2rem'
}
return (
<div style={themeStyles}>Function Theme</div>
)}

import React, { useState, useReducer } from 'react'
function reducer (state, action) {
}
return { count: state.count + 1 }
export default function App() {
const [state, dispatch]
=
function increment() { dispatch()
}
useReducer (reducer, { count: 0 })
function decrement() {
}
// setCount(prevCount => prevCount
return (
<>
-
1)
<button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
<span>{state.count}</span>
<button onClick={increment}>+</button>



this is little complex to use so see the vid

used to reduce the code

react dom vs react native -
_________________________________________________________________________

React.js vs React Native – What's the Difference?
Are React.js and React Native the same?

If you're new to the world of web and mobile development, you might be wondering the same thing.

As a newbie, it's easy to assume that React.js are React Native are the same. After all, they both have "React" as part of their name.

Though React.js and React Native share a lot in common, they're different from each other. In this article, I'll explain both React.js and React Native, then I'll list out their similarities and differences. By the end of this article, you'll have a clear knowledge of both tools and what kind of app they're used to build.

In order to have a clear understanding of the difference between React.js and React Native, we have to first dive into how a website is rendered on a web browser.

How Websites Get Rendered: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
When you type the URL of a website into your browser's address bar and click enter, the browser requests the website, and the web server sends an HTML file to the browser.

The HTML file contains the content of the webpage and the linked files such as images, videos, and stylesheets. The web browser parses the HTML file and builds a Document Object Model (DOM) which is a tree-like structure containing the elements of the page (for example, buttons, paragraphs, links, and so on).

The browser initiates requests for the linked files and downloads them to the computer. It then parses the linked files, such as CSS and JavaScript, and applies the styling to the content, making it more presentable to the user. After all the files are downloaded, the browser renders the content on the screen.

The browser also runs any JavaScript code to make the page interactive. So, for example, if the user fills the wrong information in a form, JavaScript can be used to insert a <div> element into the page showing an error message to the user.

However, one of the biggest problems of inserting elements into the DOM with JavaScript is that the code is not reusable. For example, if you want to insert the same button into the page, but with different background colors, you have to create the element twice in JavaScript:

let blueBtn = document.createElement("button").style.backgroundColor("blue")
let redBtn = document.createElement("button").style.backgroundColor("red")

// Insert blue and red button into the page
This is just a simple example. With complex user interfaces, you can imagine how long and confusing things can become. React was developed to solve this problem by making the process of creating web apps much more organized and intuitive.

What is React.js?
Technically speaking, ReactJS is an open-source, front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. In simple terms, this means that you can use React to build all the parts of a website that the user can see and interact with on their browser window.

So what's the difference between using plain JavaScript and React? Well, React makes the process of designing the user interface much easier. It allows you to create elements that you can easily re-use in other parts of the website or app.

With JavaScript, I previously mentioned how you'll need to write the same code twice to create the same button with different colors, which could lead to complexity in large projects.

React's component architecture solves this problem brilliantly. With React, you define a single piece of the UI, say a button, as a component.

const Button (props) => {
	return (
    	<div>
        	<button style={props.color}>Submit</button>
        </div>
    )
}
The component in this case is a function that returns HTML-like syntax called JSX, which defines the presentation and look of the component on the web browser.

Now, say you want to use the same button (but with different colors) in multiple places on your website. Instead of creating each button from scratch with different color properties  (as you would with JavaScript), with React, you simple use the same <Button> element and pass a different color to each of them as props, creating variations of the same button.

<Button color="red" />
<Button color="blue" />
<Button color="green" />
This method keeps everything simple and organized, which is the whole essence of the React.js library.

Another benefit of using React for UI development is separation of concerns. This means that the data used in a component exists separately from the logic, which exists separately from the view layer.

Here's an example:

const Button (props) => {
	// component data
    const [btnText, setBtnText] = useState("Submit")
    
    // component logic
    function onClick() {
    	setBtnText("Submitted!")
    }
    
	return (
    	// component view
    	<div>
        	<button style={props.color}>{btnText}</button>
        </div>
    )
}
As you can see here, the state, logic and presentation of a component are all separate from each other, making React UI components easier to understand and compose.

To conclude, React is a JavaScript library designed to simplify the process to building the frontend of web applications.

What is React Native?
Here's the main difference between ReactJS and React Native:

React JS is used to build the user interface of web applications (that is, apps that run on a web browser)
React Native is used to build applications that run on both iOS and Android devices (that is, cross-platform mobile applications)
React uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces. React Native, on the other hand, uses native UI components and APIs to create mobile apps.
Both React JS and React Native share the same syntax. React Native was created as a way for developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using their existing knowledge of web development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the React core library.

In fact, some of the libraries commonly used together with React to develop web applications also have a mobile version for building apps in React Native – for example, Axios, Bootstrap CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

Here are the things React DOM and React Native have in common:

They both use the same core React library.
They both use the same component-based architecture, which means that developers can break down their applications into smaller, more manageable pieces.
They both use JavaScript as their programming language, and JSX as their templating language.
Both React DOM and React Native use virtual DOMs to render their applications.
Both React DOM and React Native also use the same styling techniques and components, through React Native's is a bit different.
They both utilize Chrome DevTools for debugging applications.
They use the same JavaScript APIs.
Both were developed in Meta. React was developed by a software engineer named Jordan Walke while React Native was born from a hackathon.
Conclusion
This article explored the differences between React DOM and React Native, two popular JavaScript tools. React DOM is primarily used for web development, while React Native is used for mobile development.

React DOM uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout and styling, and allows developers to create interactive user interfaces. React Native, on the other hand, uses native UI components and APIs to create cross-platform mobile applications.






react router-
___________________

react router is used to create multiple webpages in a single web app 

eg:www.mfs.com
    www.mfs.com/button
    www.mfs.com/button/button
    etc.....


to install the react router dom version use this

npm i react-router-dom

there is also another version for react native dudes

npm i react-router-native


after that edit the index.js which is in the src directory where app.js is also present

add :

import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"

and wrap the app with     

<BrowserRouter>    </BrowserRouter>

the full content will be like 


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
console.log("index from src")
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
    
    <App />
    
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);



creation and routing of pages - 
_________________________________________________________________________

first create the required pages in this format

remember the file name and the page name should start with capital letters others should be in lowercase

export function Files(){
    return <h1>baba naidu @ 360 . in </h1>
}

where Files is the app name and return is where u type the web content and save that file ".js" eg File.js here

its bettert the method name nad file name matches

and modify the App.js as 


import { Route,Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import { Files } from "./Files"


function App(){
  return <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Files/>}/> //default page is also the files page
    <Route path="/files" element={<Files/>}/>
     // the /files are url eg localhost:8080/files
  </Routes>
}



i am also creating other pages just an eg for better knowledge refer it 

Application.js-

import React , { useState } from 'react';
import FileUpload from './Fileupload';
import { EthProvider } from "./contexts/EthContext";
import Demo from "./components/Demo";


const Application = () => {

  const [fileUrl,setFileUrl] = useState("");
  console.log("app.js from src")

  
  return (
    <div>
      <FileUpload setUrl={setFileUrl} />
      FileUrl : {""}
      <a href={fileUrl}>{fileUrl + ""}</a>
      <br></br>
      <EthProvider>
        <div id="App">
          <div className="container">
            <h1>
            <Demo />
            </h1>
          </div>
        </div>
      </EthProvider>
    </div>
  );
};

export { Application }; //this is another type how u export the application else this error will be output

(or this error the solution is given above)



Compiled with problems:X

ERROR in ./src/App.js 12:36-47

export 'Application' (imported as 'Application') was not found in './Application' (possible exports: default)



in both case remove default and add {appname} to avoid this error




Files.js-

export function Files(){
    return <h1>baba naidu @ 360 . in </h1>
}

export default App



app.js-

import { Route,Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import { Application } from "./Application"
import { Files } from "./Files"


function App(){
  return <Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<Application />} />
    <Route path="/files" element={<Files/>}/>
  </Routes>
}

export default App




i hope u did got it

now we are creating the different links for different pages using <Link>

this is used to navigate to different pages without using any anchor tag (<a herf></a>)

import { Link, Route,Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import { Application } from "./Application"
import { Files } from "./Files"


function App(){
  return <>
  
  <nav>
    <h1><Link to="/">Upload</Link></h1>
    <h1><Link to="/files">Files</Link></h1>//these are links 
  </nav>

  <Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<Application />} />
    <Route path="/files" element={<Files/>}/>
  </Routes>
  </>
}

export default App



how to avoid the reloading using prevent on default

this is to stop refreshing on the form submission






useState set method is not updating the values soon -

use the useEffect method

like this 





FileReader()-
_________________

https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-filereader/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AR-6X_98rM

when u are choosing a file and it is stored in the array u can access it by

e.files                   //this will return a array 

to get the 0th index   

e.files[0]

// ignore this // </Link>


to read the contents of the file u can use the reader


u need to create the instance of the reader

const reader =new FileReader()

u need to call the reader to read the file as text 

reader.readAsText(file)

the file componunt can be e.target.file[0]

and the operation that need to be performed on the load can be defned as 

reader.

for eg u have a csv file or any file to read tyhe contents of the file u can do this :::: remember the reader.onload will only execute at last

func (e){
  cosnt reader = new FileReader()
  reader.readAsText(e.files[0])
  reader.onload = () =>{
    console.log(reader.result)
  }
}

u can also read files as data dont worry of security its always in base64 format


eg code :

file upload :::

encrypt :::::::




npm i cors

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors





npm i buffer
https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer



npm i child_process


npm i react-native-aes-crypto



npm i fs
this is a simle file writer and u can also delete the files 




npm i sjcl
