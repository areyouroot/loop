prettier is a html and css code formating extension then go to
setting -> search default format -> select the extention installed then we need
to change another config in setting search format on save and enable it then
search auto save -> on focus change u can press ! then enter to get the basic
html structure see the basic definition for the html and css google it -> ? 

the
element inside the another element is called child element and the the element
uwhich hold it is called parrent element eg :

<h1><h2></h2></h1>

here h1 is parrent and h2 is child of the h1 the tag types-
<!DOCTYPE html>

this represents the current file is a html file

<html></html>
this is where the html cotent starts and ends

<head></head>
this is the head element that represents the content of the head tab

<body></body>
this represents the actual conmtent of the web page to know about other tags go
to w3 schools.com only important things are avalible here u can install a image
preview extention in the vscode to see the image in the left side of the code u
can also install the auto rename

u can install the auto close tag extention and live server extention so that u get some automation and auto close tage also at the bottom right u will see (go live press it to run the server and copy the port and paste it to see the webpage)

first child -

    this is a pesudoClass secletor like if 
        li:first-child{
            style
        }
    this is a nice example of the first child element here all the li tag where its the first child of its parrent it will put the style to them u can also do to other childs 

    li:nth-child(position of child where u want to apply this style){
        style
    }

    it can be used to select he odd and even childs 

    li:nth-child(odd/even){
        style
    }

    eg :
        li:nth-child(odd){
            color : red;
        }
        li:nth-child(2){
            color: blue;
        }

check out the text-decoration

inline is a small block element which is stored side by side and block level elements are stored in a single big block

to display that we use display conditon eg :
        
        display:inline
        display:block
        
        or mix of both 
        
        display:inline-block

absolute positioning - 

when this style is applied to a element the element has no effect of the other element it will float
u can define the position by top bottom left right eg:
    position:absolute;
    top:0;
    bottom:0;
    left:10;

relative posotioning - 

this the position to a related to another element element
child postion should be absolute and parrent should be absolute

you can select based on the elements like 

    p::first-line{

    }
    p::first-letter{

    }

u can have 2 selectors combined with + 

u can use after to give the content or any elements or other things using content

    h2::after(or)before{
        content : "any content";
        style for that
        using inline block u can define the position
    }

u can debuge the code by using some online websites 

u can resize the cwetain elements to the float object by creating a empty div and 

    .classname{
        clear:both; /*it works but i dont know why*/
    }

// clear doesnt allow the floating elements to exist

    else u can use the after param

    (selector)::after{
        clear:both;
    }
